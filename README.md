- 👋 Hi, I’m Kenneth, everyone either calls me Ken or Kenny for the most part. 
I'm 32 and currently a full-time student at Full Sail University for my Bachelor's of
Science in Game Design degree.

- 👀 I’m interested in, quite literally, everything dealing with games 1st and cars 2nd. From playing
them down to the more monotonous, tedious stuff dealing with coding and programming. Other than that, on
a typical day I have either a computer screen in front of me, or I'm working on the rebuild for
my 1995 Mitsubishi Eclipse GSX. 

- 🌱 I’m in transition from completing my Design Tools course, which covered the basics to game design
using Unreal Engine and Unity Hub. To starting my Intro to Game Design course, which examines the active
role of game designers and developers, observe and analyze multiple game designs to understand how
all the elements interact in each.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything dealing with game design and development, and I'm always
available at any time thanks to being able to work and attend college from home.
